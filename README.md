﻿# BSManager


BSManager is a small portable utility to switch automatically on and off the Vive Base Stations with the VR Headset.

It does support all Pimax models and the Vive Pro headsets.

Base Stations v1 and v2 are both supported.


## **USE AT YOUR OWN RISK**


## Installation

It's a portable application; the only software pre-requisite is the Desktop Runtime for .NET Core 3.1 (https://versionsof.net/core/3.1/3.1.19/) but it should be self-contained.

Move it into a permanent directory, you can create a shortcut to launch it or use the drop-down menu option to create it on the desktop.

If you wish in the drop-down menu you can also select "Run at Startup" and it will be run at every current user logon.

To control the Base Stations you need a BLE adapter. The HeadSet Bluetooth adapter, if any, can't be used.

In theory there's no need to pair the Base Stations in Windows but if they are not seen try it (their name starts with "HTC BS " or "LHB-").

If you get many errors or can't see the Base Stations they are too far from to the USB dongle/antenna, shorten the distance.


## Usage

There's no main window, only the drop-down menu accessible clicking with right mouse button on the system tray icon.

You can check the BS discovered, the HMD status, configure the startup, the Steam VR DB and enable logging (it will create a BSManager.log file).

At startup if the HMD is found active the software will send the base stations a wake-up command or a sleep command if the HMD is off (this only for v1).

Base stations are not discovered, the App will listen to BLE Advertisement messages.

The 2nd number is "Discovered:" after the / is the count of Base Stations found in the SteamVR database.

The icon on the left of the Base Station will change upon a correct wake-up or sleep command is received. After the name the pending action, if any, is displayed.

Only for the BS v2 if the last issued command is Sleep and the Base Stations are still On after 5 minutes the command will be re-sent.

Only for the BS v1 the Stations will be briefly powered on, about 30 seconds, to set the Sleep mode (they don't report the power state).

BSManager can automatically start & kill Pimax Runtime & close selected SteamVR components (which reduces risk of SteamVR crashes).

Manage Runtime is an option that can be enabled in the System Tray Icon drop-down menu; it can be enabled if the Pimax Runtime is not in the default directory running only once BSManager with Admin privileges.

With Manage Runtime enabled Pitool is automatically open and closed. The process will start about 15 seconds after the HMD has changed state to allow reboots (HMD reboot, Pimax service restart or manual on/off) without disruptions.

There's also support for customizable lists of processes to close when the Headset is powered off. There's a graceful and an immediate killing list. It's better if possible to use the graceful list. Unfortunately this will not work for processes that doesn't directly close like Pitool which are asking for user input to quit the application.

The default list for processes to be killed gracefully is: "vrmonitor", "vrdashboard", "ReviveOverlay", "vrmonitor" (twice in the list to repeat attempts to close). To customize the graceful list use a "BSManager.grace.txt" file in the same directory of BSManager.exe, one process per line (will replace the default).

The immediate killing list (SIGTERM) is empty by default and can be customized using a "BSManager.kill.txt" file in the same directory of BSManager.exe, one process per line
